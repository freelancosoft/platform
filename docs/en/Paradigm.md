The paradigm can be divided into two parts:

### [Logical model](Logical_model.md)

Describes the system's immediate functionality, i.e. what the system knows how to do, what data it takes as input, and what data it returns.

### [Physical model](Physical_model.md)

It includes everything else - everything related to the development, performance improvement and management of a working system.
